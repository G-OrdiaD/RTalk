# RTalk - Real-time Chat Application DevOps Solution

This project implements a complete DevOps solution for RTalk, a modern, web-based chat application with user authentication. The solution focuses on containerized deployment, orchestration, and continuous delivery.

## 📌 Project Overview

RTalk is built with a microservices-inspired architecture:

| Component           | Technology                       |
|-------------------- |----------------------------------|
| **Frontend**        | React.js                         |
| **Backend**         | Node.js/Express with Socket.io   |
| **Database**        | MongoDB                          |
| **Data Store**      | Redis                            |

The core DevOps solution leverages the following technologies:

  * **Containerization**: Docker
  * **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (using Docker Desktop for local setup)
  * **Package Management**: Helm

## 🚀 Key DevOps Achievements

### ✅ Portable & Consistent Deployment

We ensure a consistent environment from development to production through **Docker containers**. This approach eliminates "it works on my machine" issues and provides a reliable foundation for our application.

  * **Multi-stage builds**: Used to create optimized, lightweight production images.
  * **Helm charts**: Provide version-controlled, declarative deployments to Kubernetes, making our application's configuration repeatable and manageable.

### ✅ Scalable Orchestration

Kubernete manages the application's microservices, ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization.

  **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**: Automatically scales backend pods based on CPU and memory usage, allowing the application to handle varying traffic loads without manual intervention.
  **Version-Controlled Deployments**: Helm charts ensure that every deployment is a traceable and repeatable event.
  **Real-time Communication**: Redis is used as a Pub/Sub message broker, enabling Socket.IO to broadcast messages across multiple backend pods, ensuring the chat functionality remains consistent and scalable.

### ✅ Progressive Delivery & Automation

Our deployment strategy enables a safe and automated delivery process.

  * **Canary releases**: Implemented with Helm to gradually roll out new versions to a small subset of users, allowing us to monitor performance and stability before a full rollout.
  * **Automated rollbacks**: Our Helm-based deployment strategy includes built-in rollback capabilities, allowing us to quickly revert to a previous stable version if issues are detected.
  * **Health checks**: Readiness and liveness probes are configured to ensure that traffic is only sent to healthy pods.

## 🛠️ Implementation & Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * **Docker Desktop with Kubernetes**: Ensure Kubernetes is enabled in the Docker Desktop settings.
  * **Helm v3+**: The package manager for Kubernetes.
  * **Node.js 16+**: For local development.

### 1\. Local Development with Docker Compose

For a quick local setup, use Docker Compose to spin up all the services.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rtalk.git
cd rtalk

# 2. Start the services
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Access the application
# Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
```

### 2\. Kubernetes Local Setup

Before deploying with Helm, ensure your local Kubernetes cluster is running. The files for the Kubernetes resources are located in the `k8s/` directory.

```bash
# Verify your Kubernetes context
kubectl get nodes

# You can apply the manifests directly for testing purposes
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

### 3\. Deploying to Kubernetes with Helm

Once your local Kubernetes cluster is running, you can deploy the application using the provided Helm chart.

```bash
# 1. Install the Helm chart
helm install rtalk ./chart

# 2. To upgrade a deployment (e.g., a new version)
helm upgrade rtalk ./chart

# 3. To perform a canary release
# This command deploys a new version alongside the stable one,
# directing a small portion of traffic to it.
helm upgrade rtalk ./chart --set canary.enabled=true --set canary.replicaCount=1

# 4. To promote the canary version after successful testing
helm upgrade rtalk ./chart --set canary.enabled=false
```

## 📈 Future Roadmap

1.  **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement a robust monitoring solution with **Prometheus** for metrics collection and **Grafana** for visualization, providing detailed dashboards for application and infrastructure health.
2.  **Centralized Logging**: Integrate an **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to aggregate and analyze logs from all services, enabling faster troubleshooting and deeper insights.
3.  **Automated CI/CD**: Set up a **Jenkins** pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process, enabling true continuous delivery.
4.  **Persistent Storage**: Implement persistent volume claims for MongoDB to ensure data survives pod restarts and migrations.
5.  **Security Hardening**: Introduce network policies and pod security contexts to secure the cluster.
